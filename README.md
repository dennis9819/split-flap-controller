# 3D Printable split flap display
This is a 3D printable, expandable split flap display based on the original design of [David KÃ¶nigsmann](https://github.com/davidkingsman/split-flap).
This version uses his drum and flap design but completly redesigns the electrical system.
Notable changes:
* New, more rigid case design.
* Hot-swappable modules
* New Backplane
* New PCB, using mostly smd components and an atmega8 mcu.
* RS-485 bus
* Custom leightweight protocol
* Controller, running an WebSockets-Server.
* Homing-Failure and overcurrent detection
* Address and calibration data is stored in EEPROM

The firmware as well as the Server is completly rewritten wrfrom scratch in plain c and can easily be ported to other mcu's.

__Ongoing Project! This repository is not final.__
